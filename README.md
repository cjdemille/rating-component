## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was good practice working with handling HTML forms in JavaScript. I also learned more about using styling inputs based on type, and styling the label for an input based on whether or not the input is selected. 

### Continued development

This feature could be built more efficiently with React.
